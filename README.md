# DivineCore — AI Operating System

DivineCore is DivineSide's internal AI Operating System. Five autonomous modules run business functions end-to-end. This repo contains all agent definitions, workflow exports, knowledge base tooling, and infrastructure config.

## The Five Modules

### Module 1 — Branding OS
Full content pipeline from idea to publish-ready output.

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| IMAGYN | Idea generation — pulls from Kallaway KB + working examples |
| LYRA | Script writing — emotional resonance, story structure |
| MONTAGE | Editing brief — b-roll, pacing, music, transitions |
| FORGE | Visual prompt generation for diffusion models (Midjourney, Runway, Flux) |
| VIGIL | Performance feedback loop — Instagram Graph API + YouTube Analytics |

Knowledge base:
- **Airtable** — Kallaway framework lessons (51+ entries, exact retrieval)
- **Supabase + pgvector** — Working content examples, semantic search via OpenAI embeddings

### Module 2 — Sales OS
Active pipeline management and outbound. Initiates contact, sends follow-ups, tracks deals.

Agents: Lead Agent, Follow-up Agent, Deal Agent  
Knowledge base: Alex Hormozi $100M series — offer construction, lead conversion, pipeline frameworks

### Module 3 — Ops OS
Gap detection and manual escalation. When any pipeline reaches a step requiring human intervention, Ops OS detects it and alerts the right person immediately.

Agents: Task Agent, Reminder Agent, Monitoring Agent

### Module 4 — Pulse
Alert and accountability layer. Runs across all module channels simultaneously.

- Morning digest at 03:30 IST
- Progressive deadline reminders
- Breach detection and escalation
- Admin commands via private #pulse channel

Model: GPT-4o mini via OpenRouter  
Task database: Airtable — DivineCore base, Task table

### Module 5 — Networking & Recruitment OS
Automates outreach and recruiting at scale across platforms.

Current: YouTube comment bots, Discord server bots  
Expanding to: LinkedIn, Reddit, Skool, WhatsApp

## Working Conventions

- **One agent, one job.** Never combine responsibilities. Separate agents = less hallucination, lower cost, more precise outputs.
- **n8n handles orchestration.** Triggers, routing, inter-agent handoffs, scheduled workflows.
- **Commit workflow exports.** Every time an n8n workflow is updated, export the JSON and commit it to the relevant module folder.
- **Manual first, automate second.** Document the manual process before building automation.
- **Research drives architecture.** Every agent is backed by a defined knowledge base source.
- **Scope boundary.** This repo and Claude Code only touch DivineCore AIOS workflows. Client workflows (chatbots, appointment flows, payment flows) are separate and not managed here.

## Progress Tracking

All progress is tracked via git commit messages. Every commit describes what changed and what was updated — `git log` is the source of truth for what's been built and when.
