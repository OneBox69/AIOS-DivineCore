# Swipe File — Cross-Channel Content Examples

> Raw, full-content examples you've seen and admire. The "I should remember this format" file.
>
> **Templates** (hook patterns, CTA patterns, closing patterns) live in the per-channel playbook — [`linkedin-playbook.md`](linkedin-playbook.md) §02–04, [`x-playbook.md`](x-playbook.md) once it grows them. Templates are platform-mechanics-bound.
>
> **This file** holds raw examples — real posts / threads / videos / scripts — with notes on what specifically works. The mechanics differ across channels; the *moves* (pattern interrupts, payoff structure, specific-receipts) transfer.
>
> **Update discipline**: when you screenshot, save, or scroll past something that hits — paste it in here within 24 hours. It rots otherwise.

## How to log an example

For each entry:

1. **Source / author** — name + handle + platform
2. **Raw content** — paste the full post / thread / video link / script. Don't summarise.
3. **What works** — 1–3 bullets on the specific mechanic. Be precise. *"Great post"* rots; *"the second sentence inverts the first reader assumption"* doesn't.
4. **Transfers to** — which of our channels this would adapt to (LinkedIn / X / YouTube short / YouTube long / sales email).

## How agents should use this

Any writing agent (LinkedIn / X / YouTube / sales email) can load this file as optional reference material. Most useful in the "edit for voice" step ([`linkedin-playbook.md`](linkedin-playbook.md) §06 step 4) — looking at a real example next to an AI draft makes the tone gap visible.

### Example 1 — Auditing autonomous AI agents

> **Source / author:** *(unattributed; fill in when re-encountered)*
> **Posted / logged:** 2026-05-13
> **Topic intent:** Pang wants to write his own version of this topic. Highly relevant to DivineSide because we ship autonomous agents for clients. Angles: permissions audits, decision logs, the human-in-loop tradeoff (our "humans supervise" framing per [`../../CLAUDE.md`](../../../CLAUDE.md) §1), and how client trust scales with audit-ability as AI OS deployments expand.

> 1️⃣ 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗺𝗶𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀. Before anything else, audit what your AI agents have access to. Permissions are static. They are the one thing you can check today without needing a new framework. If an agent has access it should not have, that is your first finding.

> 2️⃣ 𝗧𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝗰𝗮𝗽𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗱𝗲𝗰𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗮𝘂𝗱𝗶𝘁 𝗹𝗼𝗴𝘀. Not every micro-step. High-level decision logs that let you reconstruct what happened and why after the fact. Retrospective visibility is not perfect but it is what we have right now.

> ➜ I think this is what is coming in the next six months.
>
> Autonomous agents will make mistakes. Because we as humans did not think through every permutation, limitation and edge case when we designed what they were supposed to do.
>
> Those mistakes will trigger retrospective loops. Lessons learned. Process refinement. Agent retraining. Not even a failure of AI. It is the actual implementation reality nobody is talking about, honestly.

> For anyone starting out in GRC or AI security, this is your entry point.
>
> Audit permissions first. Build logging second. And get comfortable with the fact that the audit frameworks for autonomous AI are still being written in real time.

> **What works:**
> - **Paradox-as-hook.** Opens with a question, then sets up a forced dichotomy (human-in-loop kills automation vs. no-human creates unreviewed decisions). The reader keeps scrolling to find where the third option is.
> - **Specific terminology drop.** Names *"ACE (Agent Context Engineering)"* with an instruction to Google it. Signals insider knowledge, gives the reader a follow-up action that builds trust without selling anything.
> - **Actionable today vs. waiting for the field to mature.** Closes with *"audit permissions first, build logging second."* Concrete first steps that work even though the broader frameworks aren't written yet. Turns abstract anxiety into a Monday-morning task list.
>
> **Transfers to:** LinkedIn (native fit), X (would adapt as a 6–8 tweet thread with the paradox in T1 and the ACE term as the surprise mid-thread payoff), YouTube short (the *"there's no clean middle ground yet"* line is a strong cold-open hook).

## 04 · Cross-Channel Patterns

For *moves* that aren't tied to one platform — abstract patterns you can name.

### Pattern 1

> **Pattern name:** *(e.g. "credibility-then-contrarian", "screenshot-first-context-second", "specific-number-then-payoff")*
> **Where you've seen it:** *(handles / channels)*
> **Why it transfers:** *(one sentence)*
> **How we'd use it:** *(specific to DivineSide content)*

## What this file is NOT

- **Not a content calendar** — that's `branding_os/`'s job.
- **Not template patterns** — those live in the per-channel playbook ([`linkedin-playbook.md`](linkedin-playbook.md) §02–04 for LinkedIn hooks/CTAs/closings).
- **Not strategy or voice** — those live in [`voice.md`](../identity/voice.md), [`pang.md`](../identity/pang.md), [`mayank.md`](../identity/mayank.md), [`audience.md`](../identity/audience.md).
- **Not knowledge bases or frameworks** — Kallaway's framework lessons live in `branding_os/knowledge-base/`. This file is for *raw examples* you've seen and admired, not the theory behind them.
